Not checked in yet: network AWD Summary. also calculates volume. Fixed bug
in vertical coordinate conversion.  Check cross-sections for errors.


v2-31:	   Version 2.31.  Zoom factor removed.  Zoom window implemented, but
	   doesn't work very well.  All Icon images read from the jar
	   file.  createNTShortcuts and createNTMenuItems replaced with 
	   csdp.bat file.  Remove Centerline feature added Bug fixes:  
	   Repainted problems fixed.  Previously not possible to view 
	   some cross-sections if Color By Year and low thickness.
	   Previously not possible to view a cross-section that contained
	   bathymetry data at the bottom or top (southern or northern)
	   boundaries of the data set.
v2-4:	   Version 2.4.  Zoom Winow implemented, not tested.

v2-4a:	   Zoom window implemented, along with pan, undo
	   last zoom/pan, and fit.  All files (bathymetry, 
	   network, landmark, and digital line graph) should have 
	   metadata.  If they don't, default coordinates (Utm
	   zone 10 nad 27, ngvd 1929) will be assigned.  All features
	   still need testing.

v2-4b:	   Zoom window, pan, undo, fit bugs fixed.  Bugs in metadata I/O
	   fixed.  Added Display-Change Elevation Bins to change the bins
	   used in the legend when coloring bathymetry data by elevation.
	   Added Xsect-Extract Data for extracting data for HEC-RAS.

v2-4c:	   Fixed bug in network coordinate conversion.  When a network,
	   landmark, or channel outline file is loaded, its coordinates
	   are adjusted if necessary to match the bathymetry datum.  Bathymetry data
	   now stored as primitive arrays instead of resizable array
	   objects.  Changed methods that returned arrays to void methods
	   that change array objects passed as arguments.

v2-4d:	   Add File-Save Zoomed Data, which saves
	   only bathymetry data that is currently visible in window.
	   Changed _fremontWeirElevation in CsdpFunctions from 33.5 to
	   30.5, which is the correct NGVD 1929 value.  33.5 is the value
	   in the USED datum. Removed error dialog which appeared with
	   total width of all cross-sections was zero.

v2-5:	   Fixed bug in cross-section vertical datum conversion. Added
	   Landmark editing.  When writing any file, if
	   a file exists with the same name, rename it to (filename).bak.
	   Optimized performance of File-Save Zoomed Data.

v2-51	   Fixed bug in network coordinate conversion: if network file had
	   no metadata, vertical coordinates were not being converted
	   correctly.
v2-53	   Added metadata to xsect landmark file output.
