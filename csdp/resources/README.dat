1.  Point your web browser http://java.sun.com/products/.  
	Download and install JRE 1.31.
2.  Download and install the CSDP from http://modeling.water.ca.gov/delta/models/dsm2/tools/csdp/index.html
3.  put the following two lines in a batch file:
	set JAVA_COMPCMD=FORCE_SIGNON
	(path1)java -mx256m -cp (path2)csdp.jar;(path3)vista.jar;(path4)jpy.jar DWR.CSDP.Csdp

    where 
	-mx256m tells java to use 256 MB of memory.  You may want to change this number.
	path1 = location of java.exe
	path2 = location of csdp.jar
	path3 = location of vista.jar
	path4 = location of jpy.jar

Here is an example of the above command for PC users:
	c:\PROGRA~1\jdk1.31\bin\java -mx256m -cp d:\java\classes\csdp.jar;d:\java\vista\lib\vista.jar;d:\java\vista\lib\jpy.jar DWR.CSDP.Csdp

Note:  the command is all on one line.
